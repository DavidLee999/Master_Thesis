\section{Data preparation and pre-processing}
The MITIP method is an atmospheric correction and image processing method used for processing the thermal remote sensing imageries of the FireBIRD satellite. MITIP performs atmospheric corrections for TET-1 imagery first based on water vapor and elevation in order to get ground surface radiance and temperature. Afterwards, the dual channel method introduced in Chapter 2 is used detect and characterize sub-pixel temperature of hot pixels. In this section, required input data is introduced. The procedure and principles of MITIP and its products are described in following sections.\\

\subsection{Data preparation}
The TET-1 imagery inputted to the MITIP is radiometrically calibrated top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance data (Level 1B). In order to acquire ground surface radiance and temperature, atmospheric correction should be performed first.\\

\noindent The necessary atmospheric correction takes advantage of the fact that in the thermal spectral range water vapor is the dominating disturbing parameter, while aerosols play only a negligible role \parencite{Reference204}. Consequently, for the purpose of simplifying the procedure, water vapor is the only parameter that taken into account while performing atmospheric correction. Because it is impossible to retrieve information of water vapor from TET-1 imagery, external data is required and MODIS water vapor products are used here. Besides, since the water vapor decreases with elevation, the other parameter that has to be included is the elevation, which is obtained from ASTER Digital Elevation Map (DEM).\\

\noindent From Chapter 2 we know, emissivity map is required to convert the derived radiant temperature $T_{rad}$ to kinetic temperature $T_{kin}$. The emissivity map can be acquired from ASTER Global Emissivity Database (GED).\\

\noindent Finally, the input files to the MITIP are:
\begin{itemize}
\item TET-1 imagery with TOA radiance
\item Water vapor from MODIS water vapor product
\item Elevation from ASTER Global Elevation Map
\item Emissivity map from ASTER Global Emissivity Database
\end{itemize}

\noindent All the auxiliary data can be downloaded from the website of NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration).\\

\subsection{Data pre-processing}
According to the MITIP's requirements, the input data should fulfill three conditions: 1) all input data should be of format GeoTIFF; 2) all input imageries ought to be overlapped and of the same size; 3) spatial resolution of all imageries should be identical.\\

\noindent On the basis of these requirements, after downloading all the auxiliary data, we should convert them into GeoTIFF format first. Then, compared with TET-1 imagery, the individual raster file of both the ASTER data has a smaller ground coverage of around 60 km by 60 km. These small raster files of ASTER DEM and GED should be merged into one large file respectively which is able to cover the whole area of interest (AOI). Next, to ensure all the four input files are overlapped with each other, they ought to be reprojected into the same and appropriate UTM zone and resampled to the same pixel size. Finally, the TET-1 imagery is used as a standard defining the size of the input file. All input data should be clipped using TET-1 imagery as mask to guarantee that they all share the same number of rows and columns.\\

\section{Procedure of the MITIP}

The radiative transfer function in the thermal region can be expressed as \parencite{Reference304, Reference305}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{eq301}
L(\lambda) = L_p(\lambda) + \tau (\lambda) \varepsilon (\lambda) L_{bb}(\lambda, T) + \tau (\lambda) (1 - \varepsilon (\lambda)) \frac{F(\lambda)}{\pi}\\
+L_{p,s}(\lambda) + \frac{\tau (\lambda) E_g(\lambda) \frac{\rho (\lambda)}{\pi}}{1 - \rho (\lambda) s(\lambda)}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent with:\\
\indent $L(\lambda)$: at-sensor radiance\\
\indent $L_p(\lambda)$: thermal path radiance\\
\indent $\tau (\lambda)$: ground-to-sensor atmospheric transmittance\\
\indent $\varepsilon (\lambda)$: emissivity\\
\indent $L_{bb}(\lambda, T)$: blackbody radiance at the ground surface\\
\indent $F(\lambda)$: thermal downwelling flux on the ground\\
\indent $L_{p, s}(\lambda)$: solar scattered path radiance\\
\indent $E_g(\lambda)$: global (direct + diffuse) solar flux on the ground\\
\indent $s(\lambda)$: spherical albedo\\
\indent $\rho (\lambda)$: surface reflectance\\

\noindent As most objects are opaque and do not transmit radiation, we have:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq302}
\rho (\lambda) = 1 - \varepsilon (\lambda)
\end{equation}

\noindent The first line of Equation \eqref{eq301} describes the thermal components and the second line the solar radiation. Since in this thesis we restrict ourselves to the night-time TET-1 scenes, the radiative transfer function for the MIR and TIR bands of TET-1 imagery is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq303}
L(\lambda) = L_p(\lambda) + \tau (\lambda) \varepsilon (\lambda) L_{bb}(\lambda, T) + \tau (\lambda) (1 - \varepsilon (\lambda)) \frac{F(\lambda)}{\pi}
\end{equation}

\noindent Multiplying both sides of Equation \eqref{eq303} with the channel spectral response function $R(\lambda)$ of TET-1 satellite and integrating over the bandpass field we have:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq304}
L(k) = L_p(k) + \tau (k) \varepsilon (k) L_{bb}(k, T) + \tau (k) (1 - \varepsilon (k)) \frac{F(k)}{\pi}
\end{equation}

\noindent with:\\
\indent $k$ = band number; $k$ = 1: MIR, $k$ = 2: TIR\\

\noindent In most cases of interest to fire detection, the 3 - 5 $\mu$m surface emissivity is between 0.75 - 1.0 \parencite{Reference301}, while the 8 - 12 $\mu$m emissivity is between 0.95 - 1.0 \parencite{Reference302}, as showed in Figure \ref{fig:emi_soil}, \ref{fig:emi_vegetation} and \ref{fig:emi_water}.\\

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

  \caption{Emissivity spectra for soils in the ASTER spectral emissivity database. (a) 3 - 5 $\mu$m. (b) 8 - 14 $\mu$m. \parencite{Reference303}.}
  \label{fig:emi_soil}
  
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{emi_vegetation.jpeg}
  \caption{Emissivity spectra for four types of vegetation in the ASTER spectral emissivity database. (a) 3 - 5 $\mu$m. (b) 8 - 14 $\mu$m. \parencite{Reference303}.}
  \label{fig:emi_vegetation}
  
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{emi_water.jpeg}
  \caption{Emissivity spectra for water, ice and snow in the ASTER spectral emissivity database. (a) 3 - 5 $\mu$m. (b) 8 - 14 $\mu$m. \parencite{Reference303}.}
  \label{fig:emi_water}
\end{figure}

\noindent Denote the product $\varepsilon(k) L_{bb}(k, T) = L_{surf}^*(k, T)$ as the ''effective'' or ''radiative'' surface radiance, we can get:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq305}
L_{surf}^*(k, T) = \frac{L(k) - L_p(k)}{\tau (k)} - (1 - \varepsilon (k)) \frac{F(k)}{\pi}
\end{equation}

\noindent Given in both MIR and TIR band the emissivity is close to 1, so the term $1 - \varepsilon (k)$ will be such a small term that the thermal downwelling flux term $F(k)$ will have only a small influence. Finally, all the terms $L_p(k)$, $F(k)$ and $\tau (k)$ will be calculated by MODTRAN (MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission) as a function of atmospheric water vapor volume $W(e)$, $W$ for short, which acts as a function of elevation $e$, for MIR and TIR band of TET-1 imageries respectively.\\

\noindent Finally, the surface radiance of both the black body and natural materials can be calculated from Equation \eqref{eq305}. The atmospheric correction for the night-time TET-1 scenes are done.\\

\noindent With the help of Planck's function and its inversion, surface temperature for the MIR and TIR band of TET-1 imagery can be derived. Using the dual-channel method proposed by Matson and Dozier (1981), the final HTE monitoring products including effective target temperature $T_t$, effective target pixel fraction and Fire Radiative Power (FRP) can be obtained.\\

\section{Outcomes of the MITIP}
The outcomes of MITIP can be classified into two parts: one part is the result of atmospheric correction and another the HTE monitoring product.\\

\noindent The result of atmospheric correction is the surface radiance in MIR and TIR band respectively. There are two types of surface radiance files:
\begin{itemize}
\item The ''blackbody'' surface radiance with $\varepsilon_{MIR} = \varepsilon_{TIR} = 1$;
\item The ''graybody'' surface radiance calculated from the input emissivity map $\varepsilon_{TIR}$ and assuming $\varepsilon_{MIR} = \varepsilon_{TIR}$;
\end{itemize}

\noindent The HTE monitoring product is one GeoTIFF file which consists of six bands:
\begin{itemize}
\item Band 1: surface temperature map in MIR band, $T_{MIR}$ [K];
\item Band 2: surface temperature map in TIR band, $T_{TIR}$ [K];
\item Band 3: fire probability map indicating which pixel might contain high-temperature events. For non-fire pixels, the pixel values are 0; for each detected fire pixels, the fire probability are assigned between 0.8 to 1.0;
\item Band 4: effective target temperature map [K]. For every detected fire pixel, the effective target temperature $T_t$ is calculated.  Otherwise the pixel value is set to 0;
\item Band 5: effective target pixel fraction map. The same as the effective target temperature map, for each detected fire pixel, the effective target pixel fraction $p$ is calculated. For the rest, their pixel values are set to 0;
\item Band 6: fire radiative power (FRP) [MW] map;
\end{itemize}

\noindent If, for one scene, no fire pixels are detected, the output files of HTE monitoring contains only the MIR and TIR band surface temperature maps.\\
